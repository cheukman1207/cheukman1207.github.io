# Sorting algorithms

Earlier this week in class, we came across a paragraph written by David Laing that says:

>In part because many programs utilize it as an intermediate step, sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. Consequently, a large number of efficacious sorting algorithms are available. Which algorithm is best for a given application depends on — among other factors — the number of items to be sorted, the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted, possible restrictions on the item values, the components of the machine, and the kind of storage devices to be used.

The main problem with this paragraph is that it was written using the top-to-bottom method for the purpose of demonstration. Sentences were meant to be long and also full of technical terms. This makes it hard for readers to understand, especially the ones with a lack a knowledge in the area of computer algorithms.

However, the real question is, can we make it more reader-friendly by providing examples and explaining the mechanism of the algorithms? The simple answer is yes - and it is the purpose of this blog post.

### Problem to be solved:

Nowadays, a computer will often run into a problem of sorting of kind of values in almost every task. The most frequent problem is probably sorting integers. For example, sorting the values <9, 5, 54, 2, 666> from small to large so that it returns a list of <2, 5, 9, 54, 666>. Other examples include sorting phone numbers, addresses, names, etc.


### Algorithms that we are going to cover:

In this blog, we will start with the method that is known to be the simplest for programmers (easy to understand and apply) and my personal favorite sorting method.

- Bubble sort
- Bucket sort

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is the simplest sorting method. It tells the computer to loop through the entire list and compares each pair of numbers. It then swaps their positions if the values are not in the right order. The following gif demonstrates the concept of bubble sort.

Bubble sort is also very easy to be programmed. Let's say we have a list of n random integers between 1 and 100 and we would like to sort it from small to large:

```Python
import random
list = [random.randrange(1, 101, 1) for i in range(10)]
for i in range(len(list)):
    for j in range(len(list)-1):
        if list[j] > list[j+1]:
            temp = list[j+1]
            list[j+1] = list[j]
            list[j] = temp
```

It only requires 8 lines or less of code in Python.

## Bucket Sort

Bucket sort is particularly useful for sorting values with the same format such as phone numbers. The concept is that we first break the values down into smaller groups by categorizing them and hence improves the performance of any sorting algorithm.

For example, say we have to sort 1,000 ten digits numbers (such as Canada/US phone numbers) with the order 1 to 9 for every digit. 

```Python
import random
import time
list = [random.randrange(1000000000, 9999999999, 1) for i in range(1000)]

start_time = time.time()
elapsed = end - start
for i in range(len(list)):
    for j in range(len(list)-1):
        if list[j] > list[j+1]:
            temp = list[j+1]
            list[j+1] = list[j]
            list[j] = temp
end_time = time.time()
print(end_time - start_time) 
```
With a standard bubble sort, it takes an average of 0.20s to complete the sort on my computer.
Now we try to sort the same amount of data by applying the bucket sort method:

```python
import random
import time
list = [random.randrange(1000000000, 9999999999, 1) for i in range(1000)]
new_list = []

start_time = time.time()
# Categorize them in bucket 1-9 using the first digit:
for i in range(1,10):
    temp_list = []
    for j in range(len(list)-1):
        if int(str(list[j])[:1]) == i:
            temp_list.append(list[j])
    #then run bubble sort on each sub-list
    for k in range(len(temp_list)):
        for l in range(len(temp_list)-1):
            if temp_list[l] > temp_list[l+1]:
                temp = temp_list[l+1]
                temp_list[l+1] = temp_list[l]
                temp_list[l] = temp
    #append each sorted sub-list into a new list called new_list
    for k in range(len(temp_list)):
        new_list.append(temp_list[k])

end_time = time.time()
print(end_time - start_time) 
```
This takes an average of only 0.03s to complete the sort.

### Conclusion

Bubble sort is known as the easiest sorting method but also the slowest. This helps in demonstrating how applying the bucket sort is helpful in some situation by saving the computer from doing the unnecessary work. In the case above, we didn't need to compare all the possible pairs of numbers. Instead, we asked the computer to only compare pairs that start with the same beginning digit. This reduces the labor-intensive part of the work, therefore, enhancing the performance of the machine on performing the same task with the same hardware.
